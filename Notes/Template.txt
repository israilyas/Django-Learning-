=> html page ko bhejna

In simple terms, render in Django is a way to combine a webpage template (HTML) with some data, then send that complete webpage to the user's browser.

Imagine you have a blank page (template), and you want to add some information (data) to it, like a person's name. The render() function takes care of adding the name to the blank page and gives back a finished webpage for the user to see.
